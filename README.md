# awesome-logue

Some resources for audio programming with the [korg logue sdk](https://github.com/korginc/logue-sdk), leaning towards the nts-1. 

# Tutorials
- Hammondeggs tutorial on a random LFO Mod effect [Repo](https://github.com/hammondeggs/logue_RandomLFOTutorial) | [Blog Post](https://hammondeggsmusic.ca/blognotes/note2.html)
- A 5 part series on building custom FX from DOTEC-Audio, a music plugin development company based out of Japan. Published on the Korg site, but kinda hard to find unless you know where to look [Blog Post](https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/nts_1/custom_effects.php)
- An undergrad research project where they build multiple nts-1 plugins, with code included. [Blog](https://korgnts1beginnersguide.wordpress.com/embedded-music-signal-processing/)

# Specs
- great breakdown on the [nts-1 specs](http://sandsoftwaresound.net/korg-nts-1-first-look/) from a cs/engineering professor Paul Drongowski

#Ideas
- figure out toolchain for Rust, not just C++
- VSCode setup
- Docker
